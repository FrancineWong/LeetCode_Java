/*Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to 
 * compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at 
least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of 
them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 
citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:

An easy approach is to sort the array first.*/
public class Q274_H_Index {
	public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
		int length = citations.length;
        if (length == 0) {
        	return 0;
        }
        
        int[] array2 = new int[length + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        	if (citations[i] > length) {
        		array2[length] += 1;
        	} else {
        		array2[citations[i]] += 1;
        	}
        }
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = length; i >= 0; i--) {
        	t = t + array2[i];
        	if (t >= i) {
        		return i;
        	}
